Hello! Welcome to the OP Datapack (tan jan Weki). The datapack comes with several OP items. To obtain them, simply name an armor stand ``janWekiLOOT``.

Once you have your shulker box, you can start messing around with your items.

Gives you a handful of useful effects if put in offhand/mainhand.

### janWekiFLY
If you put it in your offhand/mainhand, a platform of scaffolding will constantly be teleported below you. Hold shift to go down, jump to go up. Recommended with janWekiSUPER.

### janWekiSHEET
If put in your offhand, a sheet of evenly spaced TNT will rain down above you. The amount of TNT is directly proportional to the time you keep it in your offhand, so be careful! One second should be enough to destroy a humble cottage.
