# OP Datapack
## _tan jan Weki_

Hello! Welcome to the OP Datapack (tan jan Weki). The datapack comes with several OP items. To obtain them, simply name an armor stand ``janWekiLOOT``. Caution: this will replace your inventory with OP items. I suggest you put everything you have in a chest first.

Once you have your shulker box, you can start messing around with your items.

> WARNING: ONLY EXPERIMENT IN IMPORTANT AREAS IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. OTHERWISE, GO TO SOME ISLAND THOULSANDS OF BLOCKS FROM SPAWN TO TEST.

### janWekiSUPER
Gives you a handful of useful effects if put in offhand/mainhand. You become pretty much invulnerable, and only supermobs can deal enough damage to kill you.

### janWekiFLY
If you put it in your offhand/mainhand, a platform of scaffolding will constantly be teleported below you. Hold shift to go down, jump to go up. Recommended with janWekiSUPER.

### janWekiMISSILE
If put in your offhand, a sheet of evenly spaced TNT will rain down above you. The amount of TNT is directly proportional to the time you keep it in your offhand, so be careful! One second should be enough to destroy a humble cottage.

### janWekiKILLER
If put in offhand, a strand of TNT will appear at the nearest entity that is not you. You shouldn't be afraid of blowing up because you are given absorption for 5 seconds after use.

### janWekiWARDEN
Spawns OP wardens when put in offhand.

### janWekiZOMBIE
Spawns OP zombies when put in offhand.
